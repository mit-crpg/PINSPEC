PINSPEC Monte Carlo Particle Transport Code
==========================================

The PINSPEC project project aims to provide a simple-to-use 
Python package for spectral calculations of nuclear reactor 
applications. It includes support for infinite homogeneous
spectral calculations and heterogeneous-homogeneous pin cell
equivalence calculations. A basic ENDF-VII continuous energy 
cross-section data liibrary is provided with support for users to
make additions to the library for their own applications.
The PINSPEC project started under the Computational Reactor Physics 
Group at MIT.

Complete documentation on the usage of PINSPEC is hosted on 
our GitHub wiki at https://github.com/mit-crpg/PINSPEC/wiki. 
If you are interested in the project or would like to help and 
contribute, please contact the development team. In addition, 
If you plan to use PINSPEC frequently and would like to 
contribute feedback, please `contact`_ the development team.
